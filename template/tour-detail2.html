                    <h4>Rani Ki Vav</h4>
                    <p>Rani Ki Vav (lit. 'The Queen's Stepwell') is a stepwell
                        situated in the town of Patan in Gujarat state of India.
                        It is located on the banks of Saraswati river.
                        Its construction is attributed to Udayamati, daughter
                        of Khengara of Saurashtra, queen and spouse of the
                        11th-century Chaulukya king Bhima I. Silted over,
                        it was rediscovered in 1940s and restored in 1980s by
                        the Archaeological Survey of India.</p>

                    <p>It has been listed as one of the UNESCO's World Heritage
                        Sites since 2014. The finest and one of the largest
                        examples of its kind and designed as an inverted temple
                        highlighting the sanctity of water, the stepwell is
                        divided into seven levels of stairs with sculptural
                        panels; more than 500 principal sculptures and over
                        a thousand minor ones combine religious, mythological
                        and secular imagery.HistoryRani ki vav was constructed
                        during the rule of the Chaulukya dynasty.</p>

                    <p>It is located on the banks of Saraswati river.
                        Prabandha-Chintamani, composed by the Jain monk
                        Merutunga in 1304, mentions:
                        "Udayamati, the daughter of Naravaraha Khengara, built this novel stepwell at Shripattana (Patan) surpassing the glory of the Sahastralinga Tank".
                        According to it, the stepwell was commissioned in 1063
                        and was completed after 20 years. It is generally
                        assumed that it was built in the memory of Bhima I (r.
                        c. 1022 ‚Äì 1064) by his queen Udayamati and probably
                        completed by Udayamati and Karna after his death but
                        whether she was a widow when she commissioned it is
                        disputed.</p>

                    <p>Commissariat puts the date of construction to 1032 based
                        on the architectural similarity to Vimalavasahi temple
                        on Mount Abu built in the same year. The stepwell was
                        later flooded by the Saraswati river and silted over. In
                        1890s, Henry Cousens and James Burgess visited it when
                        it was completely buried under the earth and only well
                        shaft and few pillars were visible.</p>

                    <p>They described it as being a huge pit measuring 87 metres
                        (285 ft). In Travels in Western India, James Tod
                        mentioned that the material from the stepwell was reused
                        in the other stepwell built in modern Patan, probably
                        Trikam Barot ni Vav (Bahadur Singh stepwell). In the
                        1940s, excavations carried out under the Baroda State
                        revealed the stepwell.</p>

                    <p>In 1986, a major excavation and restoration was carried
                        out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). An
                        image of Udayamati was also recovered during the
                        excavation. The restoration was carried out from 1981 to
                        1987. Rani ki vav has been declared a Monument of
                        National Importance and protected by the ASI.</p>

                    <p>It was added to the list of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites
                        on 22 June 2014. It was named India's
                        "Cleanest Iconic Place" at the 2016 Indian Sanitation
                        Conference. Architecture Rani ki vav is considered as
                        the finest and one of the largest example of stepwell
                        architecture in Gujarat. It was built at the height of
                        craftsmens‚Äô ability in stepwell construction and the
                        Maru-Gurjara architecture style, reflecting mastery of
                        this complex technique and beauty of detail and
                        proportions.</p>

                    <p>The architecture and sculptures is similar to the
                        Vimalavasahi temple on Mount Abu and Sun temple at
                        Modhera. It is classified as a Nanda-type stepwell. It
                        measures approximately 65 metres (213 ft) long, 20
                        metres (66 ft) wide and 28 metres (92 ft) deep. The
                        fourth level is the deepest and leads into a rectangular
                        tank 9.5 metres (31 ft) by 9.4 metres (31 ft), at a
                        depth of 23 metres (75 ft). The entrance is located in
                        the east while the well is located at the westernmost
                        end and consists of a shaft 10 metres (33 ft) in
                        diameter and 30 metres (98 ft) deep.</p>

                    <p>The stepwell is divided into seven levels of stairs which
                        lead down to deep circular well. A stepped corridor is
                        compartmentalized at regular intervals with pillared
                        multistory pavilions. The walls, pillars, columns,
                        brackets and beams are ornamented with carvings and
                        scroll work.</p>

                    <p>The niches in the side walls are ornamented with
                        beautiful and delicate figures and sculptures. There are
                        212 pillars in the stepwell.</p>

                    <h4>Sculptures</h4>

                    <p>There are more than 500 principal sculptures and over a
                        thousand minor ones combine religious, mythological and
                        secular imagery, often referencing literary works. The
                        ornamentation of stepwell depicts the entire universe
                        inhabited by gods and goddesses; celestial beings; men
                        and women; monks, priests and laity; animals, fishes and
                        birds including real and mythical ones; as well as
                        plants and trees.</p>

                    <p>The stepwell is designed as an underground shrine or
                        inverted temple. It has spiritual significance and
                        represents the sanctity of water. The sculptures in
                        stepwell depicts numerous Hindudeities including Brahma,
                        Vishnu, Shiva, goddesses (Devi), Ganesha, Kubera,
                        Lakulisha, Bhairava, Surya, Indra and Hayagriva. The
                        sculptures associated with Vishnu outnumbers all which
                        include Sheshashayi Vishnu (Vishnu reclined on thousand
                        hooded snake Shesha in the celestial ocean), Vishwarupa
                        Vishnu (Cosmic form of Vishnu), twenty four forms as
                        well as Dashavatara (ten incarnations) of Vishnu.</p>

                    <p>The sculptures of deities with their families such as
                        Brahma-Savitri, Uma-Maheshwar and Lakshmi-Narayan are
                        there. Notable among other sculptures are
                        Ardhanarishwara as well as large number of goddesses
                        such as Lakshmi, Parvati, Saraswati, Chamunda,
                        Durga/Mahishasurmardini with twenty hands, Kshemankari,
                        Suryani and Saptamatrikas. There are images of Navagraha
                        (nine planets) as well. There are a large number of
                        celestial beings (Apsaras).</p>

                    <p>One sculpture of Apsara depicts either applying lipstick
                        to her lips or chewing on aromatic twig while a man is
                        tickling her feet. On the northern side of the third
                        storey pavilion, there is a sculpture of an Apsara
                        warding off a monkey clinging to her leg and pulling at
                        her clothes, revealing her seductive body. At her feet,
                        there is a nude female with a snake around her neck
                        probably representing an erotic motif.</p>

                    <p>A sculpture of Nagkanya (serpent princess) with long hair
                        and swan as well as sculptures of celestial dancers in
                        classical dance positions are there. There are large
                        number of sculptures portraying women in their everyday
                        life and activities. One sculpture depicts a woman
                        combing her hair, adjusting her earring and looking
                        herself in the mirror.</p>

                    <p>Another sculptures include a woman writing a letter, a
                        young woman with scorpion climbing her right leg and her
                        clothes sliding off unknowingly, a young woman pulling a
                        beard of a dwarf- like man, a woman with fish plate in
                        her hands with a snake encircling her leg and reaching
                        out to fish. One sculpture depicts a young women coming
                        out of bath with her wet hair and a swan catching
                        droplets of water falling from her hairs as if they are
                        pearls. These women sculptures are adorned with jewelry
                        including bangles, earrings, necklaces, waist girdles,
                        anklets and others as well as with elegant clothes and
                        well combed hairs.</p>

                    <p>The variety of expressions and emotions are depicted in
                        them. They represent beauty as well love in its sublime
                        and seductive form signaling eroticism. There are
                        sculptures representing maternal love such as a woman
                        holding her child and pointing to moon to divert his
                        attention, a woman raising her child high to let him
                        pick a mango from tree, a woman in a mango grove with
                        children with her. There are gradually increasing
                        cantilevered brackets in the well shaft which are
                        profusely ornamented.</p>

                    <p>There kalpavriksha carvings on the wall repents fertility
                        and nature worship while kirtimukhas and makaras adorn
                        the basements and capitals of pillars. On the northern
                        side wall of entrance of the stepwell, there are
                        geometric lattice patterns and designs resembling
                        designs of local textile tradition of Patola. They may
                        have been adapted from the wood carvings and the
                        ceilings of the temples. Animal figures of horses,
                        elephants and lions are used as decoration of pillars
                        and basement moldings.</p>
