                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>About the Place:</h3> <br>
                <h4>Sabarmati Aashram</h4>
                <p>Sabarmati Ashram (also known as Gandhi Ashram) is located in the Sabarmati suburb of
                    Ahmedabad, Gujarat, adjoining the Ashram Road, on the banks of the River Sabarmati, 4 miles
                    (6.4 km) from the town hall. This was one of the many residences of Mahatma Gandhi who lived at Sabarmati (Gujarat) and Sevagram (Wardha, Maharashtra) when he was not travelling across India
                    or in prison.</p>

                <p>He lived in Sabarmati or Wardha for a total of twelve years with his wife Kasturba
                    Gandhi and followers, including Vinoba Bhave. The Bhagavad Gita was recited here daily as part of
                    the Ashram schedule.</p>

                <p>It was from here that Gandhi led the Dandi march also known as the Salt Satyagraha on 12 March
                    1930. In recognition of the significant influence that this march had on the Indian independence
                    movement, the Indian government has established the ashram as a national monument.</p>

                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>Gandhiji's India ashram was originally established at the Kocharab Bungalow of Jivanlal Desai, a
                    barrister and friend of Gandhi, on 25 May 1915. At that time the ashram was called the Satyagraha
                    Ashram. But Gandhi wanted to carry out various activities such as farming and animal husbandry, in
                    addition to other pursuits which called for the need of a much larger area of usable land. So two
                    years later, on 17 June 1917, the ashram was relocated to an area of thirty-six acres on the banks
                    of the river Sabarmati, and it came to be known as the Sabarmati Ashram.
                    It is believed that this is one of the ancient ashram sites of Dadhichi Rishi who had donated his
                    bones for a righteous war. His main ashram lies in Naimisharanya, near Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.
                    The Sabarmati ashram is sited between a prison and a crematorium, and Gandhi believed that a
                    satyagrahi has invariably to go to either place. Mohandas Gandhi said, "This is the right place for
                    our activities to carry on the search for truth and develop fearlessness, for on one side are the
                    iron bolts of the foreigners, and on the other the thunderbolts of Mother Nature."
                    While at the ashram, Gandhi formed a tertiary school that focused on manual labour, agriculture and
                    literacy, in order to advance his efforts for the nation's self-sufficiency. It was also from here that on 12 March 1930, Gandhi marched to Dandi, 241 miles from the ashram, with 78 companions in
                    protest at the British Salt Law, which increased the taxes on Indian salt in an effort to promote
                    sales of British salt in India. It was this march and the subsequent illegal production of salt
                    (Gandhi boiled up some salty mud in seawater) that spurred hundreds of thousands across India
                    to join in the illegal production, buying or selling of salt. This mass act of civil disobedience in turn
                    led to the imprisoning of some 60,000 by the British Raj over the following three weeks.
                    Subsequently, the government seized the ashram. Gandhi later asked the Government to give it
                    back but they were unwilling. By 22 July 1933 he had already decided to disband the ashram,
                    which had become a deserted place after the detention of so many. Then local citizens decided to
                    preserve it. On 12 March 1930 Gandhi had vowed that he would not return to the ashram until India
                    had gained independence and Gandhi did not come back to Sabarmati ashram. Gandhi was assassinated on 30 January 1948.</p>

                <h4>Present Day</h4>
                <p>The ashram now has a museum, the Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya. This had originally been located
                    in Hridaya Kunj, Gandhi's own cottage in the ashram. Then in 1963, having been designed by the
                    architect Charles Correa, the museum was built. The Sangrahalaya was then re-located into the
                    well-designed and well-furnished museum building and was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru,
                    Prime Minister of India on 10 May 1963. Memorial activities could then continue.
                    Many buildings in the Ashram have names. There is a rich history of Gandhi's naming practices. At
                    least some of the names of the buildings in the ashram, such as Nandini, and Rustom Block date back to the nineteen twenties, as is evident in a letter Gandhi wrote to Chhaganlal Joshi, the
                    Ashram‚Äòs new manager after Maganlal Gandhi‚Äòs death in April 1928.</p>

                <p>Some of the names of the buildings and sites within the ashram are:
                    Nandini: This is an old ashram guest house where visitors from India and abroad are
                    accommodated. It is situated on the right hand side of Hridaya Kunj.</p>

                <p>Vinoba Kutir: This cottage is named after Acharya Vinoba Bhave who stayed here. Today It is
                    also known as Mira Kutir after Gandhiji's disciple Mirabehn who later lived there, following
                    Gandhi's principles. She was the daughter of a British Rear-Admiral.</p>

                <p>Upasana Mandir: This is an open-air prayer ground, where after Prayers Gandhiji would refer to
                    individual's questions and as head of family would try to analyse and solve these queries. It is
                    situated between Hridaya Kunj and Magan Nivas.</p>

                <p>Magan Niwas: This hut used to be the home of the ashram manager, Maganlal Gandhi. Maganlal
                    was the cousin of Gandhi who he called the soul of the ashram.</p>
