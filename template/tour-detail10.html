                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <h3>About the Place:</h3> <br>
                    <h4>Sabarmati Riverfront</h4>
                    <p>Sabarmati Riverfront is a waterfront being developed
                        along the banks of Sabarmati river in
                        Ahmedabad, India. Proposed in the 1960s, the
                        construction began in 2005..</p>

                    <p>Since 2012, the waterfront is gradually opened to public
                        as and when facilities are constructed and various
                        facilities are actively under construction. The major
                        objectives of project are environment
                        improvement, social infrastructure and sustainable
                        development.</p>

                    <h4>Geography</h4>
                    <p>The Sabarmati river is a monsoon-fed river which has a
                        total catchment area of 21,674 square
                        kilometres (8,368 sq mi). The Dharoi Dam constructed in
                        1976 upstream of Ahmedabad controls
                        water and protects from flooding while Vasna Barrage
                        constructed in 1976 downstream retains
                        water in the river along the city banks and diverts it
                        through Fatehwadi canal for irrigation.</p>
                    <p>The Narmada Canal, which crosses Sabarmati a few
                        kilometres upstream from the city, is part of a
                        larger canal network of Sardar Sarovar Dam. The canal
                        can feed excess water to the river and
                        maintains the level of water in the river which is
                        retained through Vasna Barrage.</p>

                    <h4>History</h4>
                    <p>The first proposal for developing the riverfront was
                        presented in 1961 by the prominent citizens
                        of the city. French architect Bernard Kohn proposed an
                        ecological valley in Sabarmati basin
                        stretched from Dharoi Dam to Gulf of Cambay in the
                        1960s.</p>

                    <p>In 1964, he proposed an Integrated Planning and
                        Development of Sabarmati Riverfront by reclaiming 30
                        hectares (74 acres) of land. The project was considered
                        feasible in 1966 by the Government of Gujarat. Later he
                        distanced himself from the project citing the difference
                        between his proposal and the project being
                        implemented.</p>

                    <p>In 1976, the Riverfront Development Group proposed an
                        incremental approach for
                        the construction. In 1992, the National River
                        Conservation Plan proposed construction of sewers
                        and pumping stations to reduce water pollution.</p>
                    <p>The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) set up the
                        Sabarmati Riverfront Development
                        Corporation Ltd (SRFDCL), a special purpose vehicle, in
                        May 1997 funded by the Government of
                        India with a seed capital of ₹1 crore (US$130,000) for
                        the riverfront development.</p>

                    <p>Environmental Planning Collaborative (EPC) led by Bimal
                        Patel prepared the feasibility report in 1998. Initially
                        the proposal was to construct the riverfront to cover a
                        stretch of 10.4 kilometres (6.5 mi) stretch from Subhash
                        bridge to Vasna barrage and to reclaim 162 hectares (400
                        acres) of the riverbed.</p>

                    <p>In 2003, the project extended to cover an 11.25
                        kilometres (6.99 mi) stretch and reclamation of 202.79
                        hectares (501.1 acres) and was put on fast track. The
                        project estimated to cost ₹1,200 crore
                        (US$150 million) which was to be recovered by selling of
                        a part of reclaimed land for commercial
                        and residential purpose.</p>
                    <p>Bimal Patel-led HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt.
                        Ltd, Ahmedabad was roped in as the main architect of the
                        project. The project encountered several delays due to
                        concerns regarding water level, flooding, rehabilitation
                        of displaced slum dwellers and the opposition from the
                        activists involved with slum rehabilitation.</p>
                    <p>The construction began in 2005. The heavy engineering,
                        land reclamation and sewage system was
                        completed at the cost of ₹900 crore (US$110
                        million).</p>
                    <p>The 11.5 kilometres (7.1 mi) long lower promenades on
                        both banks are completed and some of its section were
                        opened to the public on 15 August 2012. It was
                        inaugurated by then state Chief Minister Narendra
                        Modi.</p>
                    <p>The waterfront is gradually opened to public as and when
                        facilities are finished. Various facilities are actively
                        under construction since then. Total ₹1,152 crore
                        (US$140 million) were spent on the project by 2014.</p>
                    <p>By November 2019, the ₹1,400 crore (US$180 million) were
                        spent. The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping and his wife Peng
                        Liyuan visited Sabarmati riverfront with prime minister
                        of India Narendra Modi on 17 September, 2014.</p>

                    <h4>Culture</h4>
                    <p>The riverfront is featured in several Gujarati as well as
                        Bollywood films. It hosts several annual events like
                        Sabarmati Marathon, Sabarmati Cyclothon, flower shows,
                        International Kite Festival and airshows. Its continuous
                        promenade attracts runners and fitness enthusiasts. It
                        also hosts trade shows, exhibitions and private wedding
                        events.</p>

                    <h4>Riverfront</h4>
                    <p>The average width of the river channel was 382 metres
                        (1,253 ft) and the narrowest cross-section
                        330 metres (1,080 ft). It is uniformly narrowed to 263
                        metres (863 ft) without affecting its flood
                        carrying capacity and the riverbed land is reclaimed on
                        the both east and west banks to construct
                        11.25 kilometres (6.99 mi) long riverfront. It can hold
                        470,000 cu ft/s (13,000 m3/s) without
                        spillage</p>

                    <p>The total of 202.79 hectares (501.1 acres) of land is
                        reclaimed. The reclaimed land is used for public as well
                        as private development. More than 85% of the reclaimed
                        land proposed be used for public infrastructure,
                        recreational parks, sports facilities and gardens while
                        nearly 14% proposed be used for commercial and
                        residential purpose.</p>
