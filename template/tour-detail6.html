                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>About the Place:</h3> <br>
                <h4>Jama Masjid</h4>
                <p>Jama Masjid (literally Friday Mosque), also
                    known as Jumah Mosque or Jami' Masjid, is a
                    mosque in Ahmedabad, and was built in 1424
                    during the reign of Ahmad Shah I. The inscription
                    on the central mihrab commemorates the
                    inauguration of the mosque on the 1st Safar A.H.
                    827 or January 4, 1424 A.D. by Sultan Ahmad Shah
                    I. The mosque lies in the old walled city, and it is
                    situated outside Bhadra Fort area. The old walled
                    city is divided into separate quarters or pols, and the
                    Jami' Masjid is found on the Gandhi Road. Along
                    the south side of the road, the mosque is a short
                    distance beyond the Teen Darwaza or Tripolia
                    Gate.</p>

                <p>The Jama Masjid was the fifth mosque structure
                    built during Ahmed Shah I's reign.The prior
                    mosques had either been modest in size or were for
                    private use. The Jama Masjid was the complete
                    opposite of its predecessors in that it was a large,
                    grandiose structure. The mosque complex has a
                    large paved courtyard that can be entered from
                    three different directions. The courtyard has an
                    ablution tank in the middle.The west side of the
                    building is home to the prayer hall. The entire
                    mosque is emblematic of what came to be known as
                    Gujarat style architecture.</p>

                <p>The Jama Masjid of Ahmedabad was probably the
                    largest mosque in the Indian subcontinent built in
                    this period. It lies in the center of the old walled
                    city.</p>

                <p>The northern wall of the mosque lies along a
                    processional way. Designed as part of a major plan
                    desired by Sultan Ahmed Shah I, the mosque is
                    located north of the processional axis that runs from
                    the Maidan-i Shah at the door with three arches,
                    Teen Darwaza. One enters the mosque from the
                    north using a staircase. To the east of the mosque is
                    the Badshah-ka-Hazira, also known as the Tomb of
                    Ahmad Shah. This is the tomb of Ahmad Shah I, his
                    son, and grandson. The tomb used similar architectural styles as the Jama Mosque even though it
                    was started after the completion of the mosque. Some similar architectural features include
                    the use of multiple domes, enclosed columned courts, and pierced screen walls. Although the
                    tomb did not use any novel architectural features, it was the first of its kind in Ahmedabad.
                    Nearby are the graves of the queens and the other wives of the Sultan Ahmad Shah I, which is
                    called the Rani no Hajiro or Hazira. This tomb used a similar architectural style to the Tomb of
                    Ahmad Shah.</p>

                <p>Prior to the founding of the city of Ahmedabad, the original
                    settlement's name was Asaval. Ahmad Shah I was the heir
                    apparent and in 1411 founded Ahmedabad, which eventually
                    subsumed Asaval.</p>
                
                <p>In recent years, local officials have struggled with balancing the
                    preservation of the mosque's original elements, while also
                    maintaining the structure so it is still serviceable for
                    worshipping population.The Sunni Muslim Waqf
                    Committee has replaced the original sandstone flooring of the mosque's courtyard with marble flooring. The hauj (tank) in
                    the middle of the mosque's courtyard, which worshippers use
                    to perform the act of Wudu before prayer, has also been
                    relaid. Iron frames were fixed to the windows.The Archeological Society of India has filed
                    multiple complaints in court against members of the Sunni Muslim Waqf Committee and locals for
                    violating the Archaeological Monuments and Archaeological Sites Remains Act. The Sunni
                    Muslim Waqf Committee has said, "'The ASI has neither the resources nor will to arrest the decay.
                    Most of these monuments, especially the mosques, are still used. When the ASI fails to repair a
                    crumbling monument, the onus of doing the job falls on us. We can't run away from providing
                    basic amenities to people who come to pray" concerning the claims made by the ASI.
                    Ahmedabad was founded on 26 February 1411, far from the Muslim rule in Delhi. This allowed for
                    Ahmedabad to develop its own provincial style of architecture. Ahmedabad's provincial style of
                    architecture is commonly named Gujarat style, in accordance to the name of the province. The
                    Gujarat style of architecture, and thus l Ahmedabad's style of architecture, is a mix of Islamic
                    architecture and traditional Hindu architectural elements. Although the Gujarat style flourished
                    during the 15th century and afterwards, there was a precedent for the Gujarat Islamic architecture style since Islam had been present in Gujarat a century before Ahmed Shah I rose to power and
                    founded Ahmedabad. The early mosques in Gujarat during the pre-Ahmed Shah period were
                    created from mostly pillaged temple material that was turned into mosque like structures.
                    Jama Masjid is one of many examples of the Gujarat style of architecture in Ahmedabad. The
                    monuments in and around the old city fall roughly into two categories. The first category is
                    associated with Ahmad Shah I during the first half of the 15th century and the second being
                    associated with Mahmud Begada for the second half of the 15th century and beyond.Built with yellow sandstone, the mosque complex is centered on a
                    large rectangular courtyard 75 m long and 66 m wide. One enters
                    the court by three entrances: south, east, and north. One at the
                    center of each side. The primary entrance is the south facing
                    entrance; the eastern porched entrance leads out to another
                    enclosure, the tomb of Sultan Ahmad Shah The courtyard is
                    lined with a colonnade on three sides, the prayer hall occupies the
                    western side.</p>

                <p>In the center of the courtyard is a rectangular basin
                    for ablutions.
                    The southern porch entrance to
                    the mosque is large and
                    supported by pillars, some of
                    which were reused from Hindu
                    or Jain temples. The porch is
                    elavated with twelve steps on
                    each side. It is topped by a roof
                    that once had a dome which
                    has since collapsed.
                    In its Indo-Muslim architecture, the mosque also
                    contains many syncretic elements not necessarily
                    obvious to the viewer: some of the central domes
                    are carved like lotus flowers, closely related to the
                    typical domes of Jain temples; and some of the
                    pillars are carved with the form of a bell hanging on a chain, in reference to the bells that often
                    hang in Hindu temples.The prayer room is rectangular and covered by fifteen domes. The roof of the prayer room is
                    arranged on three levels. The main prayer hall has about 260 closely set columns supporting the
                    roof, with its 15 domes, making a walk through the hall a beautiful maze of light and shadows.
                    The wide-open courtyard, floored with white marble, is ringed by a colonnade painted with giant
                    Arabic calligraphy, and has a tank for ritual ablutions in the center. The mosque and
                    arcades are built of yellow sandstone and carved with the intricate detail that mosques of this
                    period are known for. The main prayer hall space is divided into fifteen bays, or three rows of five
                    square bays, each with a dome thus totalling 15 domes. The cupola dome in the center is higher
                    than the rest. The central nave of the prayer area is three stories tall The mosque has, in total, five mihrabs that correspond with the aforementioned five square bays
                    of the main prayer hall. The five mihrabs run along the Qibla wall. The Qibla wall faces the west and is decorated with colored marble together with its mihrabs. A white marble crescent marks
                    the spot where the imam leads the prayer. Pierced stone screens (the 'Jalis') are placed between
                    the two pillars of the central openings.</p>

                <p>The main entrance is framed by two columns. They are the remains of two minarets (the 'shaking
                    minarets') destroyed by the earthquakes of 1819 and 1956. In the earthquake of 1819, the lofty
                    minarets were reduced to half their height and became known as the "shaking minarets". The
                    earthquake of 1956 destroyed the remaining "shaking minarets".</p>
